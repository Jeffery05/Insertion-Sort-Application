# Insertion-Sort-Application
Sometimes, teachers need help sorting their students. This program will be able to assist them by sorting a list of students alphabetically by their first name and by mark.

This program will first take in a list of student names and marks from a file, and store them in an array. Then, it will use insertion sort to either sort the students by first name or by mark. The name and mark of a student will always correspond, whichever way it is sorted.

*Note: In order for the program to run, please also download the text file.
